## 2026-09-06 - [Performance] Centralize os.scandir for fast mtime sorts
**Learning:** `pathlib.Path.glob` and `pathlib.Path.iterdir` combined with `key=lambda x: x.stat().st_mtime` causes redundant and slow stat system calls. Using `os.scandir` yields `os.DirEntry` objects which inherently cache `st_mtime` from the system call.
**Action:** Created `core/fs_utils.py` with `get_sorted_files_by_mtime` and `get_sorted_glob_by_mtime` helpers to utilize `os.scandir()` instead of `iterdir()`/`glob()`, and applied them across the codebase to prevent redundant OS stat calls.
